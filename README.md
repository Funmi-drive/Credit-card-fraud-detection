Every year, billions of dollars are lost to fraudulent transactions. According to report by Statista, 17.5 billion US dollars was lost to fraud through online card payments in 2020. This value was estimated to increase by over 14% in the preceding year, amounting to an approximate value of $20 billion. The development of efficient fraud detection techniques is critical for eradicating these losses, some of which are reliant on machine learning algorithms to achieve successful detections. However, due to the imbalanced nature of dataset from limited class of fraudulent transactions, the creation of predictive models seems challenging. Ultimately, the step further than the prediction, to verify the class of suspicious fraudulent transactions has since been an area with minimal focus.
